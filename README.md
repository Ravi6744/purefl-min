# 🌐 PureFL-Mini

**Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning with Blockchain and Homomorphic Encryption**

A lightweight proof-of-concept demonstrating encrypted federated learning and blockchain-based trust logging.  
Inspired by IEEE research on privacy-preserving AI for IoV systems (Ting et al., 2025).

---

## 🚀 Project Objectives
- Implement a federated learning demo using [Flower](https://flower.dev).
- Use [TenSEAL](https://github.com/OpenMined/TenSEAL) for encrypted model sharing.
- Record model update logs on [Ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/).
- Provide a simple web dashboard for monitoring progress.
